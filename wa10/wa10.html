            <h1>Reflection:</h1>
            <p>I added a random color palatte generator to the website. I uses an open source API to generate a palette around a completely random hex code generated in the Javascript.
                The mode select uses the API's own built in parameters to choose colors based off of that random hex that are either complementary, analogous, monochromatic, or triadic.
                It then displays the 5 random colors it gets from the API onto the website, as well as their hex codes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't think I would use it, but it could be cool to use to make the website more visually appealing and different whenever a user visits the page.
                I could also see myself using it to recreate the color-clutter on the actual CoolMathGames page, by having each fake game cell have it's own randomly generated color.
                This would be a lot less time consuming than choosing a color to match each fake game, and also better recreate the diversity and contrast in color on the real page.
