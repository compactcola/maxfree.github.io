    <h2>About ~</h2>
        <p>Hiya, I'm Max. I'm a Creative Technology and Design Major with a minor in Art Practices at the University of Colorado Boulder.
            <br>I have experience in coding with C++, C#, Python, GDScript, and HTML. I also have experience in game design and development with both Unity and Godot.
        </p>
    <h2><br>Interests ~</h2>
        <p>My main intrests are around video game design and development. I mainly enjoy focusing on the art direction: animations, sprites, atmosphere, story, music, etc.
            I also enjoy coding and designing games, but I am generally a lot worse at that aspect. 
            I'm also learning music production this semester and am looking forward to learning more about that as well!
            <br><br>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, drawing, and <em>playing</em> video games. My favorite right now is probably Elden Ring- although Mohg is definitely testing that.
        </p>
    <h2><br>Goals ~</h2>
        <p>I mainly want to improve at video game development. I've made a few small games, but typically have a hard time sticking with a longer project. I also want to get better at the various 
            aspects of game design that I tend to focus less on, like coding and music. 
        </p>
    
    <h3><br><br>Brainstorming 4 pointz:</h3>

        I think each section will be pretty straightforward- especially since I’m completely new to HTML. Eventually I’d want to add more flashy images, gifs, etc, but right now I’d just be happy if I can get the page to work. I’ll mostly just have simple and to the point content: my name, major, interests, experience, etc.
        <br><br>
        As of right now, before I polish it up, y’all are probably the only people visiting my website. In the future though, it will be helpful as like a live resume, or place to gather all of my works or things I’m proud of. I can also see myself using it to stay organized- keep documentation for projects and process images.
        <br><br>
        I don’t really understand what it means to organize content using semantic HTML. By my guess and from what I know, it will be pretty simple for now, using tabs, newlines, and different header and body sizes to distinguish between different sections. Eventually I’d like to have separate branching pages for individual projects, with links on my main page to them.
        <br><br>
        I honestly find the Berkshire hathaway website and that norwegian websites kind of inspiring. They both are very bad websites, but I appreciate the functionality of the Berkshire page, and the aesthetic, or lack thereof, of the other one. Overall I want my website to be better than either of these, but I still think there’s lessons and vibes to be learned from each of them.
        <br><br>
        I right now would just like to have my professional/academic side represented online. I don’t really post to social media, so I’m in a good place to keep my presence online mostly clean and professional.
