    <h2>About ~</h2>
        <p>Hiya, I'm Max. I'm a Creative Technology and Design Major with a minor in Art Practices at the University of Colorado Boulder.
            <br>I have experience in coding with C++, C#, Python, GDScript, and HTML. I also have experience in game design and development with both Unity and Godot.
        </p>
    <h2><br>Interests ~</h2>
        <p>My main intrests are around video game design and development. I mainly enjoy focusing on the art direction: animations, sprites, atmosphere, story, music, etc.
            I also enjoy coding and designing games, but I am generally a lot worse at that aspect. 
            I'm also learning music production this semester and am looking forward to learning more about that as well!
            <br><br>In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, drawing, and <em>playing</em> video games. My favorite right now is probably Elden Ring- although Mohg is definitely testing that.
        </p>
    <h2><br>Goals ~</h2>
        <p>I mainly want to improve at video game development. I've made a few small games, but typically have a hard time sticking with a longer project. I also want to get better at the various 
            aspects of game design that I tend to focus less on, like coding and music. 
        </p>
